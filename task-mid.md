# Mid Level Developer Task - Note-Taking Application

## Objective:

Build a secure note-taking web application that incorporates user authentication and automated testing.

## Technical Requirements:

### Frontend:

- Use React to create a responsive user interface.
- Enhance user interaction with effective state management for logged-in/out states.

### Backend:

- Secure the API using user authentication (e.g., JWT).
- Ensure CRUD operations are secure and user-specific.
- Implement comprehensive error handling and appropriate status codes.
- Use Express for the backend.
- Store notes in a Postgres database, with each note containing fields for the title, content, and timestamps.

### Testing:

- Develop automated tests for both frontend and backend components to ensure functionality and reliability.

## Deliverables:

- Source code with integrated user authentication and automated tests.
- A README file that provides detailed setup, usage, and testing methodology.

## Evaluation Criteria:

- Functionality: The application must perform secure and user-specific CRUD operations.
- Code Quality: Modular and well-organized code with comprehensive test coverage.
- User Experience: Provide a seamless interaction for authenticated users.

## Notes:

- Use vite for the frontend tooling and Express for the backend.
- Usage of FE design systems like Material-UI or Ant Design is encouraged.
- Consider the security implications of user authentication and data access.
- Use of ORM libraries is welcomed to facilitate database management and improve data handling.
- Innovations and improvements to the project are highly encouraged. Please document any such contributions in your README.
